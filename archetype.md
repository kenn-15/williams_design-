## Brand archetypes — a quick primer

Brand archetypes are storytelling templates that help shape a brand's personality, design, and messaging. They are distilled, human-centered roles (like Hero, Explorer, Caregiver) that guide consistent voice, visuals, and behavior across experiences. Using an archetype helps teams make aligned choices about tone, color, imagery, and microcopy so the brand feels coherent and recognisable.

Use this document as a design and content guide focused on the Caregiver archetype.

## The Caregiver archetype — summary

Core idea: protect, nurture, and support others.

Primary goal: make people feel safe, cared for, and understood.

Promise to users: reliability, empathy, and practical help.

Typical brand mission: "We exist to make people's lives easier and safer."

## Personality and values

- Empathetic and patient
- Reliable and steady
- Selfless and service-oriented
- Reassuring and protective

These values should show up in every customer touchpoint: from the way you describe your services to how your UI gives guidance and reassurance.

### Voice & word choice

Tone: calm, warm, clear, and supportive.

Preferred words and phrases:
- nurture, support, care, protect, safe, here for you, steady, trusted, guided, help, wellbeing, community, together

Phrases that work well in headlines & CTAs:
- "We're here to help"
- "Care that supports you"
- "Start your support plan"
- "Get help now" (use sparingly; prefer gentle urgency like "Get support today")

Words and tones to avoid:
- Aggressive sales language (e.g., "Buy now!", "Limited-time")
- Boastful or arrogant claims — caregivers earn trust through humility and demonstrated reliability

Microcopy tips:
- Use first-person plural or singular that emphasizes partnership: "We’ll help" / "You’re not alone"
- Keep sentences short and directive when guiding a user (e.g., "Choose a time"), but longer and softer when empathizing (e.g., "We understand — tell us what matters most").

## Visual language — color, type, imagery, and components

Overall vibe: warm, calm, approachable, uncluttered, and clearly structured.

Color palette suggestions (examples with hex values):
- Soft blues (trust & calm): #5B8FB9, #9EC0E8
- Warm neutrals (comfort & warmth): #F5EFE6, #D9CBB6
- Gentle greens (healing & balance): #7FB77E, #CFEAD6
- Accent (soft coral for human warmth): #F2AFA3

Accessibility note: choose palettes with sufficient contrast for body text and CTAs; test for color-blind accessibility.

Typography:
- Friendly humanist sans for UI: Inter, Source Sans, or Nunito (legible, neutral, friendly)
- Warm readable serif for headings or testimonials: Merriweather, Georgia (optional)
- Use moderate sizes and generous leading; readable copy is calming.

Imagery and iconography:
- Photographs: close, human-scale shots — hands, faces, caregivers in action, warm ambient light. Avoid staged or overly stylized stock imagery.
- Icons: rounded, soft, minimal — avoid sharp aggressive shapes.

Layout and interaction patterns:
- Generous whitespace and clear hierarchy to reduce cognitive load
- Rounded corners and soft shadows to imply safety and approachability
- Clear affordances for help (prominent support/contact buttons, persistent chat/help widget)
- Progressive disclosure: show simple, safe steps first and expand details as needed

If you want, I can also:
- produce a 4-color accessible palette (WCAG-tested) with suggested tints/shades
- create a sample style tile (fonts, color swatches, example hero) you can drop into a design tool
- write 5–10 variants of hero copy and CTAs to A/B test

Tell me which of those you'd like next.
