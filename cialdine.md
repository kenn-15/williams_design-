## How brands persuade people and how ad proposals are built

This document explains the psychology and practical process behind how companies persuade customers to buy from them, and how agencies or internal teams structure ad proposals and campaigns.

## Core persuasion principles (short)

1. Attention — get noticed.
2. Relevance — make the message matter to the person.
3. Emotion — connect emotionally (trust, desire, fear of loss, belonging).
4. Social proof — show others like them have bought and liked it.
5. Simplicity — make the choice obvious and easy.
6. Reciprocity/Value — give something first (discount, content) to create obligation.

These steps mirror a buyer's journey: Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Retention.

## Common persuasive frameworks

- AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action): classic funnel used in ads and landing pages.
- PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve): highlight a pain point, intensify it, then offer the solution.
- Jobs-to-be-Done: focus on the task customers hire the product to complete, not just features.
- Social Proof + Scarcity combo: trust signals + limited availability to accelerate decisions (use ethically).

## How brands translate persuasion into creative

- Headlines & hooks: single-line promises or questions that capture attention and state relevance.
- Lead with benefits, not features: show what the user gains (time, safety, confidence).
- Use testimonials and case studies early in the funnel for credibility.
- Clear single CTAs: one desired action per creative unit.

Channel tailoring
- Social (Facebook/Instagram/X/TikTok): short-form visuals, native tone, influencer or UGC elements.
- Search (Google): intent-driven, use exact benefit-driven headlines and landing pages matching queries.
- Display/Programmatic: wide reach, brand awareness with clear visual hooks.
- Email: personalized, sequence-led (welcome → nurture → convert) with strong subject lines.

## The ad proposal — structure and what clients expect

A good ad proposal communicates strategy, creative approach, media plan, measurement, and costs. Keep it concise but concrete.

Template outline:
1. Executive summary — the one-paragraph plan and expected outcome.
2. Business objectives & KPIs — revenue, CAC, CPA, LTV, awareness lift, etc.
3. Target audience — segments, psychographics, and pain points.
4. Value proposition — core message and differentiators.
5. Creative approach — example headlines, messaging pillars, and sample visuals or storyboards.
6. Channel & media plan — where to run, formats, flight dates, budget breakdown.
7. Measurement plan — what you'll track, baseline, and targets; tagging and analytics setup.
8. Test & learn roadmap — experiments, A/B tests, and optimization cadence.
9. Timeline & deliverables — creative milestones, approvals, and launch dates.
10. Pricing & legal notes — costs, billing cadence, and contractual terms.

## Example executive summary (short)

"Run a 12-week digital performance campaign targeting new parents to acquire paying customers for our subscription service. Goal: drive 1,200 trial signups at a CPA ≤ $25 while improving landing page conversion from 8% to 14% through A/B testing. We'll use short social video ads, search retargeting, and an email nurture sequence." 

## Creative examples & sample copy (two short ad scripts)

1) Problem-focused (PAS)
Headline: "Tired of bedtime battles?"
Body: "Bedtime should be calm. Our step-by-step sleep plan helped 3,000 families get 2 extra hours of sleep per night. Start your free trial."
CTA: "Start free trial"

2) Social proof + value
Headline: "Loved by thousands of parents"
Body: "Join 10,000 families who’ve improved sleep without melatonin. Get a personalized plan and 7-day free trial."
CTA: "Get my plan"

## Measurement & KPIs

Decide KPIs by stage:
- Awareness: impressions, reach, CTR
- Consideration: click-through, time-on-site, engagement
- Conversion: conversion rate, CPA, CAC
- Retention: churn rate, repeat purchase, LTV

Set realistic benchmarks based on industry and historical data. Use attribution windows and experiment with incrementality tests when budget allows.

## Testing & optimization

- Start with hypothesis-driven tests: "If we change the hero CTA to 'Start free trial' from 'Learn more', conversions will increase by 10%."
- Run A/B tests with statistically meaningful sample sizes and pre-defined success criteria.
- Optimize the whole funnel, not just the ad: landing pages, checkout flow, and email follow-ups all affect CPA.

## Pricing ad campaigns & budgeting methods

- CPM/flat budgets for brand awareness
- CPC/CPA for performance campaigns
- Consider blending: awareness drives demand, performance captures it.

Rule of thumb: assign 10–30% of budget to testing and learning during early phases.

## Pitching ads — how agencies propose creative

1. Lead with insight: start the pitch by showing a deep insight into the audience.
2. Show the idea: present a small set of creative concepts (3 big ideas) with sketches or short scripts.
3. Be concrete: include sample assets, exact media types, and a plausible budget split.
4. Offer a measurement plan: show how success will be proven with data.
5. Include a short pilot plan: a low-risk way to validate the idea before full spend.

## Ethical considerations

- Avoid manipulative tactics that prey on vulnerability (e.g., exploiting fear or illness without consent).
- Be transparent on testimonials and user data use.
- Respect privacy and comply with ad platform and local regulations (GDPR, CCPA, platform-specific policies).

## Quick templates (copy & brief)

Creative brief (one-paragraph):
"Target: busy new parents in urban areas. Tension: no time and too little sleep. Promise: a science-backed, step-by-step sleep plan that respects your family’s routine. Tone: empathetic, practical, and reassuring. KPI: CPA ≤ $25; target 1,200 trials in 12 weeks. Channels: Meta Reels, YouTube Shorts, Google Search retargeting, and email nurture. Budget: $60k total."

Ad headline bank (short list):
- "Sleep, simplified."
- "Two more hours of sleep—without the stress." 
- "Real plans. Real results." 
- "Gentle solutions for better sleep."

## How to present the proposal to stakeholders

- Start with the business goal and the expected ROI.
- Use data and benchmarks to justify assumptions.
- Walk through the customer journey and show how each channel supports the path to conversion.
- Be transparent about risks and mitigation strategies.
